        This is my third and final website of the year.

    <div class="container-fluid-2">
        Over the course of the year I have learned many coding languages and made many friends.
        The first language I learned was Html in VSC, albiet difficult at first it was exciting and new.
        The second language I learned was Java in Greenfoot, I had no understanding of it at first but as the days went by I grew accustomed to it.
        The third was C# in MSVS, it was a tricky one but I eventually managed to get the hang of it.
        One friend I made along the way was Isaac, he is really nice and funny too and we have a lot of common interests.
        Another friend I made along the way is Nick, he is semi-nice with a good attitude and positive behaviour.
        Overall I'd say that FCCC was the right choice for me.
